        <h3>FREQUENTLY ASKES QUESTIONS(FAQs)</h3>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible c1">Do I Need to Work Out Every Day?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>No, you do not need to work out every day. In fact, in most cases, I would recommend at least 1-2 days of total rest a week. However, just because you have a rest or recovery day scheduled into your calendar, doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t active at all on these days. Light, regular movement such as walking your dog around the block, or taking time for stretching or foam rolling are great recovery techniques to help increase blood flow and reduce tension in tight muscles</p>
        </div>  
        <button type="button" class="collapsible c2">How Long Should I Work Out For?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>The length of your workout will largely depend on your fitness level, as well as the type of training and intensity you’re working out at. The CDC recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity 5 days a week, as well as 2 full body strength training sessions(1). Making sure you’re hitting these minimums for exercise is a great way to make sure you’re on track.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible c3">How Often Should I Rest?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Your rest will depend on your workout schedule. Like I said previously, I recommend 1 or 2 full days of rest in your schedule. This isn’t only great for giving your body time to recover from your workouts, it also can be a great time for self-care to promote mental health.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible c4">How Long Does It Take to See Results?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>It can take anywhere from 6-8 weeks or more to see results from your program. That can be discouraging as so many of us are living in an instant world - we expect results and changes instantaneously. Don’t get discouraged. Know that your hard work is paying off, even if you don’t see the results you’re looking for on the scale right away.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible c5">How can I measure my progress?  </button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>When you start a fitness routine, you want to see results. Whether you’re looking to feel more confident, improve your strength, or simply feel healthier, it can help to know if you’re making progress. </p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible c6">What time of day is best to work out?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>The best time to work out is whenever you can fit it in! Have a look at your schedule and figure out what time of day is best for you. If your routine is flexible, think about when you feel most energetic, or when you would prefer to exercise. Morning workouts can be an energising way to start the day for some, while others prefer working out in the afternoons or evenings.</p>
